# Hello, I'm a comment. Nice to meet you.
# You can recognize me by the "#" which is at the begin of the line
# If you execute me, nothing will happen
# So, do that just press control + enter on this line
# Also you can sum up new comments putting the # at the begin
# you can do that selecting something and pressing control + shift + c
# try this key combination on the line 8 and welcome to the scripts : )
