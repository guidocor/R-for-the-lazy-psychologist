# R for the lazy psychologist 

This is the material for a course that I gave at Universidad de las Islas Baleares (Spain). The course aim is to convert a hard word (data mananing, cleaning, analysing) in a easy thing. Is called 'for the lazy psychologist' because one has to be lazy enough to not to do anything that an automated script can. In this course we start with a lot of single comma separated values files (outputs from experimental psychology software) and we end with a linear mixed effect model analysis of them. 

The structure of the course is a series of scripts which one is the teaching material and the other is the real script. These pairs of scripts are named like "01_joining_dataframes.R" (the teaching one) and "10_join_data.R" (the real one). Also some power points are attached. Is necessary to open the scripts as a R project or the scripts will not work. 

## Topics covered

- Read data from individual files
- Prepare data for analysis
- Plot exploratory graphics (currently is deprecated and I'm working on a new one with ggplot)
- Statistical analysis with 'classic' NHST tools
- Linear Mixed Effects Model analysis
